# Bunny Jump

To open you can use a vs extension called 'Live Server'.

## Introduction

The game is an inifinite jumper like Doodle Jump.

The objective is to get as high up as you can by jumping on platforms that disappear as they leave the bottom of the screen.

Falling is a death sentence. Well, virtual death sentence. You can always respawn.

## Why Web and not Unity?

Phaser 3 is a fantastic game framework that is simple enough for beginners to learn yet powerful enough to make nearly any 2D game you can think of.

The web and modern JavaScript is the ideal platform and language for beginners.

Unity is not. I've tried Unity as a beginner. The software is as intimidating as an airplane dashboard. You'd think an integrated development environment would just work but it doesn't.

All you need is Visual Studio Code, the Chrome web browser, and an internet connection.
